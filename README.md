# LIRI-Bot
>This application makes use of Node.js, the Spotify API, Axios, and Moment.js. Essentially, this is a play off of Appleâ€™s Siri (Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface), except my version is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. This is a Command Line Node application that takes in user parameters and gives data back using the following instructions:
`concert-this` `spotify-this-song` `movie-this` `do-what-it-says`

### How to use:

1. Clone repo
2. Run `npm install` in your terminal/command line 
3. In the terminal/command line, run `node liri.js <choose instruction from above>`
