This application makes use of Node.js, the Spotify API, Axios, and Moment.js. Essentially, this is a play off of Appleâ€™s Siri (Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface), except my version is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. This is a Command Line Node application that takes in user parameters and gives data back.
